## Get started in two steps

Connect your cloud accounts and start receiving cost-saving insights right away.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign up for Yasu at [app.yasu.cloud/auth/sign-up](https://app.yasu.cloud/auth/sign-up).

    You can sign up with your email or use Google/GitHub SSO for faster onboarding.

    After signing up, you'll be prompted to create your first **workspace**. A workspace is where your team collaborates on cloud cost optimization.

    <Tip>When onboarding you can invite **Team members** in the last step.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your cloud account">
    Once you're in your workspace, connect your cloud provider to start analyzing your costs.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="AWS">
        **Connect AWS via CloudFormation**

        1. Navigate to **Integrations** in the sidebar
        2. Click **Connect AWS**
        3. You'll be redirected to AWS CloudFormation to deploy a read-only IAM role
        4. Review the permissions and click **Create Stack**
        5. Once the stack is created, Yasu will automatically detect the connection

        <Info>
        Yasu uses **read-only access** to analyze your AWS costs and resources. We never make changes to your infrastructure.
        </Info>

        The CloudFormation template creates an IAM role with permissions to:
        - Read Cost Explorer data
        - List resources across services
        - Access CloudWatch metrics
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="GCP">
        **Connect GCP via OAuth**

        1. Navigate to **Integrations** in the sidebar
        2. Click **Connect GCP**
        3. Sign in with your Google account that has access to the GCP project
        4. Select the project(s) you want to connect
        5. Grant the required permissions

        <Info>
        Yasu requests **read-only access** to your GCP billing and resource data. We never make changes to your infrastructure.
        </Info>

        Yasu will request access to:
        - Billing account data
        - Project resource information
        - Compute and storage metrics
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once connected, Yasu immediately starts analyzing your cloud environment:

1. **Cost data syncs** — Your historical cost data is imported (this may take a few minutes)
2. **AI analysis begins** — Our agents scan for optimization opportunities
3. **Insights appear** — You'll see your first Quick Wins on the dashboard
