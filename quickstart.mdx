## Get started in five steps

Connect your cloud accounts and start receiving cost-saving insights right away.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign up for Yasu at [app.yasu.cloud/auth/sign-up](https://app.yasu.cloud/auth/sign-up).

    You can sign up with your email or use Google/GitHub SSO for faster onboarding.

    After signing up, you'll be prompted to create your first **workspace**. A workspace is where your team collaborates on cloud cost optimization.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your cloud account">
    Select your cloud provider to start analyzing your costs.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="AWS">
        **Connect AWS via CloudFormation**

        Click **Connect AWS** and you'll be redirected to AWS CloudFormation with our template pre-loaded.

        <img src="images/onboarding/connect_aws.jpg" />

        1. Review the stack name and parameters (pre-filled for you)
        2. Scroll to the bottom and check the acknowledgment box
        3. Click **Create Stack**

        <Info>
        Yasu uses **read-only access** to analyze your AWS costs and resources. We never make changes to your infrastructure.
        </Info>

        **Verify the connection**

        Once the CloudFormation stack completes, Yasu automatically detects the connection. You'll see the verification screen:

        <img src="images/onboarding/connect_aws_verify.jpg" />

        The CloudFormation template creates an IAM role with permissions to:
        - Read Cost Explorer data
        - List resources across services
        - Access CloudWatch metrics
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="GCP">
        **Connect GCP via OAuth**

        Click **Connect GCP** to start the OAuth flow.

        <img src="images/onboarding/connect_gcp.jpg" />

        1. Sign in with your Google account that has access to the GCP project
        2. Select the project(s) you want to connect
        3. Grant the required permissions

        <Info>
        Yasu requests **read-only access** to your GCP billing and resource data. We never make changes to your infrastructure.
        </Info>

        Yasu will request access to:
        - Billing account data
        - Project resource information
        - Compute and storage metrics
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start your AI agents">
    After connecting your cloud account, configure which AI agents you want to activate. These agents continuously analyze your infrastructure for cost-saving opportunities.

    <img src="images/onboarding/connect_aws_agents.jpg" />

    Select the agents that match your optimization goals:
    - **Cost Analyzer** — Identifies idle and underutilized resources
    - **Right-Sizing Agent** — Recommends optimal instance sizes
    - **Reserved Instance Advisor** — Finds RI and Savings Plan opportunities

    <Tip>You can enable or disable agents at any time from Settings.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Invite your team">
    Collaborate with your team by inviting members to your workspace.

    <img src="images/onboarding/onboarding_invite_team.jpg" />

    Enter email addresses of team members you want to invite. They'll receive an invitation to join your Yasu workspace.

    <Info>
    You can manage team members and permissions later from **Settings** → **Members**.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="See your insights">
    Once setup is complete, you'll land on your dashboard where cost-saving insights start appearing.

    <img src="images/ui/dashboard.jpg" />

    Your dashboard shows:
    - **Current spend** — Real-time cloud cost tracking
    - **Quick Wins** — AI-powered savings recommendations
    - **Forecast** — Predicted costs for the coming month
    - **Services breakdown** — Costs by cloud service

    <Check>
    Most users see their first cost-saving recommendations within **5 minutes** of connecting.
    </Check>
