Connect your **Azure account** to Yasu by creating a Service Principal with read-only permissions. This enables Yasu to analyze your cloud costs and provide optimization recommendations.

<Info>
**Security First:** Yasu uses a Service Principal with read-only permissions. We cannot modify, create, or delete any Azure resources.
</Info>

## Subscription-Level Setup (All Billing Account Types)

This guide covers connecting Azure subscriptions to Yasu using subscription-level RBAC roles. This setup method works for **all Azure billing account types**, including:

- **Pay as You Go** (Individual subscriptions)
- **Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)**
- **Enterprise Agreement (EA)**
- **Azure Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)**

<Info>
**Universal Setup:** Subscription-level RBAC roles provide access to cost data and resources for all billing account types. Simply create a Service Principal and assign roles at the subscription scope - no billing account ID or enrollment number is required.
</Info>

{/* ### Advanced Setup Options

If you need organization-wide cost visibility or billing account-level access, you can use these advanced setup guides:

## Prerequisites

Before connecting your Azure account, ensure you have:

- **Administrative access** to your Azure subscription (or permissions to create Service Principals and assign RBAC roles)
- **Subscription Owner or User Access Administrator** role to assign permissions
- Access to Azure Portal or Azure CLI
- PowerShell or Azure CLI installed (for automated setup)

## Quick Setup via PowerShell Script

The fastest way to connect your Azure account is through our automated PowerShell script.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Integrations">

1. Log in to your Yasu dashboard at [app.yasu.cloud](https://app.yasu.cloud)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
3. Click **Connect Azure**

</Step>

<Step title="Download and Run Setup Script">

You'll see a PowerShell script that you can copy and run in Azure Cloud Shell or your local PowerShell environment.

1. **Copy the script** from the Yasu dashboard
2. **Open Azure Cloud Shell** (recommended) or PowerShell with Azure module installed
3. **Paste and run the script**

The script will:
- Create a Service Principal named `yasu-cost-optimizer-{your-account-id}`
- Assign required RBAC roles (Reader, Cost Management Reader, Monitoring Reader)
- Output your connection credentials

<Warning>
**Important:** Save the credentials securely. The client secret will only be shown once.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Enter Credentials in Yasu">

After running the script, you'll receive:

- **Tenant ID** (Directory ID)
- **Subscription ID**
- **Client ID** (Application ID)
- **Client Secret**

Enter these credentials in the Yasu dashboard:

1. Return to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Connect Azure**
2. Fill in the credential fields:
   - Tenant ID
   - Subscription ID
   - Client ID (Application ID)
   - Client Secret
3. Click **Connect Account**

</Step>

<Step title="Wait for Verification">

Yasu will automatically verify your connection:

- ✅ **Authentication test** - Verifies Service Principal credentials
- ✅ **Permission check** - Confirms required roles are assigned
- ✅ **Subscription access** - Validates subscription access
- ✅ **Cost Management access** - Tests cost data access

This typically takes **1-2 minutes**.

</Step>

<Step title="Verify Connection Status">

Return to your Yasu dashboard. You should see:

- ✅ **Connection status**: Active
- ✅ **Subscription Name**: Your Azure subscription name
- ✅ **Data sync**: In progress

<Check>
Your first cost-saving insights will appear within **5-10 minutes** after connection.
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Manual Setup via Azure Portal

If you prefer to set up the Service Principal manually through the Azure Portal:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Application Registration">

1. Navigate to **Azure Portal** → **Microsoft Entra ID** (Azure Active Directory)
2. Go to **App registrations** → **+ New registration**
3. Set **Name**: `yasu-cost-optimizer-{your-account-id}`
4. Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**
5. Click **Register**
6. **Copy the following values** (you'll need them later):
   - **Application (client) ID**
   - **Directory (tenant) ID**

</Step>

<Step title="Generate Client Secret">

1. In the app registration, go to **Certificates &amp; secrets**
2. Click **+ New client secret**
3. Enter a **Description**: `Yasu Access Key`
4. Select **Expires**: Choose **24 months** (recommended)
5. Click **Add**
6. **Copy the secret Value immediately** - it won't be shown again

<Warning>
**Important:** If this secret expires, you'll need to create a new one and update it in Yasu before expiration. Set a reminder for 30 days before expiration.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Assign RBAC Roles">

The Service Principal needs the following roles at the **Subscription** scope:

1. Navigate to **Subscriptions** → Select your subscription
2. Go to **Access control (IAM)** → **+ Add** → **Add role assignment**
3. Assign each role one by one:

   **Role 1: Reader**
   - **Role**: Select **Reader**
   - **Assign access to**: User, group, or service principal
   - **Select members**: Search for and select your `yasu-cost-optimizer-*` app
   - Click **Review + assign**

   **Role 2: Cost Management Reader**
   - Repeat the process with **Cost Management Reader** role

   **Role 3: Monitoring Reader**
   - Repeat the process with **Monitoring Reader** role

<Note>
Role assignments may take up to 5 minutes to propagate. Wait a few minutes before testing the connection.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Complete Connection in Yasu">

1. Return to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Connect Azure** in Yasu
2. Enter the credentials:
   - **Tenant ID**: Directory (tenant) ID from Step 1
   - **Subscription ID**: Your Azure subscription ID
   - **Client ID**: Application (client) ID from Step 1
   - **Client Secret**: The secret value from Step 2
3. Click **Connect Account**

</Step>
</Steps>

## What the Service Principal Needs

The Service Principal is granted the following **read-only** RBAC roles at the subscription scope:

| Role | Purpose | Permissions |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Reader** | Read all Azure resources | `*/read` |
| **Cost Management Reader** | Access cost and billing data | `Microsoft.Consumption/*/read`, `Microsoft.CostManagement/*/read` |
| **Monitoring Reader** | Access metrics and monitoring data | `Microsoft.Insights/*/read`, `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/*/read` |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Authentication failed">

**Common causes:**

1. **Wrong tenant ID** - Verify you're using the correct Directory (tenant) ID
2. **Wrong client ID** - Check the Application (client) ID matches your app registration
3. **Wrong client secret** - The secret may have expired or been regenerated
4. **Secret expired** - Create a new client secret and update it in Yasu

**Solution:**

```powershell
# Verify credentials work
az login --service-principal \
  --username {client-id} \
  --password {client-secret} \
  --tenant {tenant-id}

# If failed, reset credentials
az ad app credential reset --id {client-id}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Access denied or insufficient permissions">

**What to check:**

1. **Missing role assignments** - Verify all three roles are assigned (Reader, Cost Management Reader, Monitoring Reader)
2. **Role propagation delay** - Azure role assignments can take up to 5 minutes to propagate
3. **Wrong scope** - Ensure roles are assigned at the Subscription level, not Resource Group level

**Solution:**

```powershell
# Check current role assignments
az role assignment list --assignee {client-id} --all

# Add missing role
az role assignment create \
  --assignee {client-id} \
  --role "Cost Management Reader" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}"

# Wait 5 minutes for propagation
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Subscription not found">

**What to check:**

1. **Wrong subscription ID** - Verify the subscription ID is correct
2. **Service Principal not granted access** - The SP needs Reader role at subscription scope
3. **Subscription disabled** - Check subscription state in Azure Portal

**Solution:**

```powershell
# List available subscriptions
az account list --output table

# Verify subscription exists and is enabled
az account show --subscription {subscription-id}

# Grant access to subscription
az role assignment create \
  --assignee {client-id} \
  --role "Reader" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}"
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing cost data">

**What to check:**

1. **Cost Management API access** - Verify Cost Management Reader role is assigned at subscription scope
2. **Data delay** - Cost data may take 24-48 hours to appear after first connection
3. **Subscription billing** - Ensure the subscription has active billing and resources

**Solution:**

- Verify Cost Management Reader role is assigned at the subscription level
- Wait 24-48 hours for initial cost data sync
- Check that the subscription has incurred charges (not in free/trial period)
- For organization-wide cost visibility, consider using the MCA/EA/CSP setup guides

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rate limiting (429 errors)">

**What it means:** Too many API calls in a short time period.

**Solution:**

- Yasu automatically implements exponential backoff
- Large subscriptions may take longer to fully scan
- Wait for the full sync cycle (up to 6 hours for large subscriptions)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Client secret expiration">

**What to do:**

1. Create a new client secret in Azure Portal (App Registration → Certificates &amp; secrets)
2. Update the secret in Yasu before the old one expires:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → Your Azure connection
   - Click **Update Client Secret**
   - Enter the new secret value
   - Save changes

<Warning>
**Important:** Update the secret at least 30 days before expiration to avoid service interruption.
</Warning>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cost data delay">

**What it means:** Cost data may take time to appear after connecting.

**Common causes:**
- Cost data typically takes 24-48 hours to appear after subscription creation
- Cost Management API may require additional time for first-time access
- Subscription may not have incurred any charges yet

**Solution:**
- Wait 24-48 hours after connecting for initial cost data sync
- Verify the subscription has active resources and billing activity
- Check that Cost Management Reader role is correctly assigned at subscription scope
- Ensure the subscription is not in a trial or free tier period

</Accordion>
