## What Yasu Does

Yasu is an **AI-powered FinOps platform** that provides complete visibility into your cloud costs across AWS, Azure, and GCP—all in one unified dashboard.

Our platform tracks and optimizes three core areas:

- **Cost Visibility** — Real-time spending data, forecasts, and service-level breakdowns
- **AI-Powered Insights** — Automated recommendations with estimated savings for each optimization
- **Shift-Left Prevention** — Cost gates and PR integration to prevent expensive mistakes before deployment

<Info>
**Why Shift-Left?** Catching a costly misconfiguration during code review is **10x cheaper** than fixing it in production. Yasu integrates directly into your development workflow.
</Info>

## How Yasu Works

Yasu connects to your cloud accounts via secure, read-only access and continuously analyzes your infrastructure for optimization opportunities.

**Autonomous AI Agents** — Unlike static rule-based tools, Yasu uses self-learning AI agents that understand your business context and make intelligent cost-saving recommendations.

**Multi-Cloud Unified View** — Whether you're on AWS, Azure, GCP, or all three, Yasu consolidates your costs into a single dashboard with consistent metrics.

**Non-Disruptive Integration** — Yasu integrates seamlessly into your existing workflows through GitHub webhooks, Slack notifications, and CI/CD pipelines.
